    "### Using Modin\n",
    "\n",
    "To use Modin, only a single line of code must be changed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Simply change:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import pandas as pd\n",
    "```\n",
    "to\n",
    "```python\n",
    "import modin.pandas as pd\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Changing this line of code will allow you to use all of the cores in your machine to do computation on your data. One of the major performance bottlenecks of Pandas is that it only uses a single core for any given computation. **Modin** exposes an API that is identical to Pandas, allowing you to continue interacting with your data as you would with Pandas. **There are no additional commands required to use Modin locally.** Partitioning, scheduling, data transfer, and other related concerns are all handled by **Modin** and **Ray** under the hood.\n",
