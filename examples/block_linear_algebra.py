# This class represents a distributed matrix with an array of object IDs, each
# of which corresponds to one block in the overall matrix.

# EXERCISE: Define a remote function which returns a BlockMatrix of zeros. You
# can assume that len(shape) == 2. You can do this as follows.
#   - First call the BlockMatrix constructor with the appropriate shape.
#   - Then call "zeros_helper" to create an object ID for each entry of
#     the "block_ids" field of the BlockMatrix.
#
# NOTE: You could call "zeros_helper" once for every block in the BlockMatrix,
# but since object IDs refer to immutable objects, if you create two matrices
# of zeros with the same shape, then you could choose to reuse the same object
# ID for both of them.
#
# EXERCISE: Implement this method more efficiently by reusing object IDs for
# the blocks that have shape block_size x block_size.

# np.ones and then call that multiple times inside of this function.

# EXERCISE: Define a remote function which compares two BlockMatrix objects "a"
# and "b" and returns true if
#
#    absolute(a - b) <= (atol + rtol * absolute(b))
#
# holds element-wise and false otherwise. For the equivalent numpy method, see
# https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.allclose.html.

# EXERCISE: Implement a remote function which multiplies two BlockMatrix
# objects "a" and "b" and returns their product as a BlockMatrix.
#
# You may find it helpful to define a helper function that takes a row of
# blocks from "a" and column of blocks from "b" and returns their product as a
# numpy array.
#
# Note that to make a Python function take a variable number of arguments, you
# can use the following signature.
#
#     def f(*ids):
#       print(ids)
#
# And then you can call f as follows.
#
#     f(*[1, 2, 3])
#
# This will print "[1, 2, 3]".
#
# For Ray, this trick matters because object ID arguments will be fetched and
# the corresponding Python objects will be passed into the remote function.
# However, if an object ID is passed in inside of a list (or other structure),
# its value will not be fetched and it will be passed in unchanged.
