    "# Exercise 5 - Actor Handles\n",
    "\n",
    "**GOAL:** The goal of this exercise is to show how to pass around actor handles.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we wish to have multiple tasks invoke methods on the same actor. For example, we may have a single actor that records logging information from a number of tasks. We can achieve this by passing a handle to the actor as an argument into the relevant tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Concepts for this Exercise - Actor  Handles\n",
    "\n",
    "First of all, suppose we've created an actor as follows.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "@ray.remote\n",
    "class Actor(object):\n",
    "    def method(self):\n",
    "        pass\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create the actor\n",
    "actor = Actor.remote()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Then we can define a remote function (or another actor) that takes an actor handle as an argument.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "@ray.remote\n",
    "def f(actor):\n",
    "    # We can invoke methods on the actor.\n",
    "    x_id = actor.method.remote()\n",
    "    # We can block and get the results.\n",
    "    return ray.get(x_id)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Then we can invoke the remote function a few times and pass in the actor handle.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Each of the three tasks created below will invoke methods on the same actor.\n",
    "f.remote(actor)\n",
