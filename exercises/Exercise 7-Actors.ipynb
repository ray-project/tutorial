    "Sometimes you need a \"worker\" process to have \"state\". For example, that\n",
    "state might be a neural network, a simulator environment, a counter, or\n",
    "something else entirely. However, remote functions are side-effect free. That\n",
    "is, they operate on inputs and produce outputs, but they don't change the\n",
    "state of the worker they execute on.\n",
    "\n",
    "Actors are different. When we instantiate an actor, a brand new worker is\n",
    "created, and all methods that are called on that actor are executed on the\n",
    "newly created worker.\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that with a single actor, no parallelism can be achieved because\n",
