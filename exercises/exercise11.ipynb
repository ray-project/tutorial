    "# Exercise 11 - Custom Resources\n",
    "\n",
    "**GOAL:** The goal of this exercise is to show how to use custom resources\n",
    "\n",
    "See the documentation on using Ray with custom resources http://ray.readthedocs.io/en/latest/resources.html#custom-resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Concepts for this Exercise - Using Custom Resources\n",
    "\n",
    "We've discussed how to specify a task's CPU and GPU requirements, but there are many other kinds of resources. For example, a task may require a dataset, which only lives on a few machines, or it may need to be scheduled on a machine with extra memory. These kinds of requirements can be expressed through the use of custom resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "Custom resources are most useful in the multi-machine setting. However, this exercise illustrates their usage in the single-machine setting.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ray can be started with a dictionary of custom resources (mapping resource name to resource quantity) as follows.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "ray.init(resources={'CustomResource1': 1, 'CustomResource2': 4})\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The resource requirements of a remote function or actor can be specified in a similar way.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "@ray.remote(resources={'CustomResource2': 1})\n",
    "def f():\n",
    "    return 1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Even if there are many CPUs on the machine, only 4 copies of `f` can be executed concurrently.\n",
    "\n",
    "Custom resources give applications a great deal of flexibility. For example, if you wish to control precisely which machine a task gets scheduled on, you can simply start each machine with a different custom resource (e.g., start machine `n` with resource `Custom_n` and then tasks that should be scheduled on machine `n` can require resource `Custom_n`. However, this usage has drawbacks because it makes the code less portable and less resilient to machine failures."
