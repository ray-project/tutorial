    "# Exercise 8 - Speed up Serialization\n",
    "\n",
    "**GOAL:** The goal of this exercise is to illustrate how to speed up serialization by using `ray.put`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Concepts for this Exercise - ray.put\n",
    "\n",
    "Object IDs can be created in multiple ways.\n",
    "- They are returned by remote function calls.\n",
    "- They are returned by actor method calls.\n",
    "- They are returned by `ray.put`.\n",
    "\n",
    "When an object is passed to `ray.put`, the object is serialized using the Apache Arrow format (see https://arrow.apache.org/ for more information about Arrow) and copied into a shared memory object store. This object will then be available to other workers on the same machine via shared memory. If it is needed by workers on another machine, it will be shipped under the hood.\n",
    "\n",
    "**When objects are passed into a remote function, Ray puts them in the object store under the hood.** That is, if `f` is a remote function, the code\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "x = np.zeros(1000)\n",
    "f.remote(x)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "is essentially transformed under the hood to\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "x = np.zeros(1000)\n",
    "x_id = ray.put(x)\n",
    "f.remote(x_id)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The call to `ray.put` copies the numpy array into the shared-memory object store, from where it can be read by all of the worker processes (without additional copying). However, if you do something like\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "for i in range(10):\n",
    "    f.remote(x)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "then 10 copies of the array will be placed into the object store. This takes up more memory in the object store than is necessary, and it also takes time to copy the array into the object store over and over. This can be made more efficient by placing the array in the object store only once as follows.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "x_id = ray.put(x)\n",
    "for i in range(10):\n",
    "    f.remote(x_id)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, you will speed up the code below and reduce the memory footprint by calling `ray.put` on the neural net weights before passing them into the remote functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**WARNING:** This exercise requires a lot of memory to run. If this notebook is running within a Docker container, then the docker container must be started with a large shared-memory file system. This can be done by starting the docker container with the `--shm-size` flag."
