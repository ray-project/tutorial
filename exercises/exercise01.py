# The goal of this exercise is to show how to run simple tasks in parallel.
#
# EXERCISE: This script is too slow, and the computation is embarrassingly
# parallel. Use Ray to execute the functions in parallel to speed it up.
#
# NOTE: This exercise should work even if you have only one core on your
# machine because the function that we're parallelizing is just sleeping.
# However, in general you would not expect a larger speedup than the number of
# cores on the machine.

  # computes the number of CPUs using psutil.cpu_count(). The argument
  # redirect_output=True just hides some logging.
