# The goal of this exercise is to show how to send neural network weights
# between workers and the driver.
#
# Since pickling and unpickling a TensorFlow graph can be inefficient or may
# not work at all, it is most efficient to ship the weights between processes
# as a dictionary of numpy arrays.
#
# We provide the helper class ray.experimental.TensorFlowVariables to help with
# get and set weights. Similar techniques should work other neural net
# libraries.
#
# Consider the following neural net definition.
#
#     import tensorflow as tf
#
#     x_data = tf.placeholder(tf.float32, shape=[100])
#     y_data = tf.placeholder(tf.float32, shape=[100])
#
#     w = tf.Variable(tf.random_uniform([1], -1.0, 1.0))
#     b = tf.Variable(tf.zeros([1]))
#     y = w * x_data + b
#
#     loss = tf.reduce_mean(tf.square(y - y_data))
#     optimizer = tf.train.GradientDescentOptimizer(0.5)
#     grads = optimizer.compute_gradients(loss)
#     train = optimizer.apply_gradients(grads)
#
#     init = tf.global_variables_initializer()
#     sess = tf.Session()
#     sess.run(init)
#
# Then we can use the helper class as follows.
#
#     variables = ray.experimental.TensorFlowVariables(loss, sess)
#     weights = variables.get_weights()
#     variables.set_weights(weights)
#
# Note that there are analogous methods "variables.get_flat" and
# "variables.set_flat", which concatenate the weights as a single array insead
# of a dictionary.
#
# EXERCISE: Use the ray.experimental.TensorFlowVariables helper class to
# implement the set_weights and get_weights methods for the actor so that the
# driver can retrieve the weights from the actor and set new weights on the
# actor.
#
# EXERCISE: Additionally, use the actor methods to retrieve the neural net
# weights from all the actors, then average the weights, and then set the
# average on all of the actors.
