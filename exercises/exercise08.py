# The goal of this exercise is to show how to use actors. In this exercise, we
# define a remote function which creates a neural network and a gym
# environment and uses the network to do a rollout in the environment. However,
# every time a rollout is done, a new network is created. If the network
# creation is expensive (e.g., the network is placed on a GPU), then this will
# be slow.
