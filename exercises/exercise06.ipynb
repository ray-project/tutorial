    "# Exercise 6 - Handling Slow Tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "**GOAL:** The goal of this exercise is to show how to use `ray.wait` to avoid waiting for slow tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "See the documentation for ray.wait at https://ray.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html#ray.wait.\n",
    "\n",
    "This script starts 6 tasks, each of which takes a random amount of time to complete. We'd like to process the results in two batches (each of size 3). Change the code so that instead of waiting for a fixed set of 3 tasks to finish, we make the first batch consist of the first 3 tasks that complete. The second batch should consist of the 3 remaining tasks. Do this exercise by using `ray.wait`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Concepts for this Exercise - ray.wait\n",
    "\n",
    "After launching a number of tasks, you may want to know which ones have finished executing. This can be done with `ray.wait`. The function works as follows.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "ready_ids, remaining_ids = ray.wait(object_ids, num_returns=1, timeout=None)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Arguments:**\n",
    "- `object_ids`: This is a list of object IDs.\n",
    "- `num_returns`: This is maximum number of object IDs to wait for. The default value is `1`.\n",
    "- `timeout`: This is the maximum amount of time in milliseconds to wait for. So `ray.wait` will block until either `num_returns` objects are ready or until `timeout` milliseconds have passed.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Return values:**\n",
    "- `ready_ids`: This is a list of object IDs that are available in the object store.\n",
    "- `remaining_ids`: This is a list of the IDs that were in `object_ids` but are not in `ready_ids`, so the IDs in `ready_ids` and `remaining_ids` together make up all the IDs in `object_ids`."
