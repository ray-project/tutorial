# The goal of this exercise is to combine a handful of lessons in a single
# example and to get some practice parallelizing serial code. In this exercise,
# we create a neural network and a gym environment and use the network to do
# some rollouts (that is, we use the neural net to choose actions to take in
# the environment). However, all of the rollouts are done serially.
#
# EXERCISE: Change this code to do rollouts in parallel. To avoid recreating
# the neural net over and over, you may want to use actors.
