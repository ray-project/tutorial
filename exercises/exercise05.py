# The goal of this exercise is to show how to use ray.wait to avoid waiting for
# slow tasks.
#
# EXERCISE: This script starts 20 tasks, each of which takes a random amount of
# time to complete. We'd like to process the results in two batches (each of
# size 10). Change the code so that instead of waiting for a fixed set of 10
# tasks to finish, we make the first batch consist of the first 10 tasks that
# complete. The second batch should consist of the remaining tasks.
