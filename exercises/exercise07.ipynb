    "See the documentation on actors at http://ray.readthedocs.io/en/latest/actors.html.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes you need a \"worker\" process to have \"state\". For example, that state might be a neural network, a simulator environment, a counter, or something else entirely. However, remote functions are side-effect free. That is, they operate on inputs and produce outputs, but they don't change the state of the worker they execute on.\n",
    "\n",
    "Actors are different. When we instantiate an actor, a brand new worker is created, and all methods that are called on that actor are executed on the newly created worker.\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that with a single actor, no parallelism can be achieved because calls to the actor's methods will be executed one at a time. However, multiple actors can be created and methods can be executed on them in parallel."
