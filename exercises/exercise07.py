# The goal of this exercise is to show how to create an actor and to call actor
# methods.
#
# Sometimes you need a "worker" process to have "state". For example, that
# state might be a neural network, a simulator environment, a counter, or
# something else entirely. However, remote functions are side-effect free. That
# is, they operate on inputs and produce outputs, but they don't change the
# state of the worker they execute on.
#
# Actors are different. When we instantiate an actor, a brand new worker is
# created, and all methods that are called on that actor are executed on the
# newly created worker.
#
# This means that with a single actor, no parallelism can be achieved because
# calls to the actor's methods will be executed one at a time. However,
# multiple actors can be created and methods can be executed on them in
# parallel.
#
# EXERCISE: Use actors to execute the code below remotely and to enable the
# tasks to share mutable state with each other.
