-------------

Here are tutorial notebooks for using Tune. 

1. exercise_1_basics.ipynb covers basics of using Tune - creating your first training function and using Tune. This tutorial uses Keras.
2. exercise_2_optimize.ipynb covers Search algorithms and Trial Schedulers. This tutorial uses PyTorch.


Concepts that are generally useful but have not been covered: 

1. Using PBT
2. Creating a Trainable with save and restore functions and checkpointing
3. Distributed execution on a larger cluster

Please open an issue if you have any questions or identify any issues. All suggestions and contributions welcome!
