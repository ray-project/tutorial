    "# RL Exercise 2 - Proximal Policy Optimization\n",
    "\n",
    "**GOAL:** The goal of this exercise is to demonstrate how to use the proximal policy optimization (PPO) algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "To understand how to use **RLlib**, see the documentation at http://rllib.io.\n",
    "\n",
    "PPO is described in detail in https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.06347. It is a variant of Trust Region Policy Optimization (TRPO) described in https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.05477\n",
    "\n",
    "PPO works in two phases. In one phase, a large number of rollouts are performed (in parallel). The rollouts are then aggregated on the driver and a surrogate optimization objective is defined based on those rollouts. We then use SGD to find the policy that maximizes that objective with a penalty term for diverging too much from the current policy.\n",

    "![ppo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ucbrise/risecamp/risecamp2018/ray/tutorial/rllib_exercises/ppo.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTE:** The SGD optimization step is best performed in a data-parallel manner over multiple GPUs. This is exposed through the `num_gpus` field of the `config` dictionary (for this to work, you must be using a machine that has GPUs)."
