    "# Exercise 7 - Process Tasks in Order of Completion\n",

    "**GOAL:** The goal of this exercise is to show how to use `ray.wait` to process tasks in the order that they finish.\n",

    "## Concepts for this exercise - `ray.wait`\n",
    "\n",
    "After launching a number of tasks, you may want to run the results sequentially. To do so, we build off of exercise 6 and use `ray.wait` to execute the results sequentially. \n",
    "\n",
    "We are able to use `ray.wait` because the two lists returned by **`ray.wait` maintains the ordering of the input list**. That is, if `f` is a remote function, the code \n",
    "```python\n",
    "    results = ray.wait([f.remote(i) for i in range(100)], num_returns=10)\n",
    "```\n",
    "will return `(ready_list, remain_list)` and the `ObjectID`s of in those lists will be ordered by the argument passed to `f` above."
