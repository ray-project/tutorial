    "# Exercise 1 - Simple Parallelization\n",
    "\n",
    "**GOAL:** The goal of this exercise is to show how to run simple tasks in parallel.\n",
    "\n",
    "This script is running too slowly, but the computation is embarrassingly parallel. In this exercise, you will use Ray to execute the functions in parallel to speed it up.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Introduction to Remote Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "The `@ray.remote` decorator turns a Python function into a \"remote function\" that Ray can run in parallel. Here is a simple example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# A regular Python function.\n",
    "def regular_function():\n",
    "    return 1\n",
    "\n",
    "# A Ray remote function.\n",
    "@ray.remote\n",
    "def remote_function():\n",
    "    return 1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a few key differences between the original function and the decorated one:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Invocation:** The regular version is called with `regular_function()`, whereas the remote version is called with `remote_function.remote()`.\n",
    "2. **Return values:** `regular_function` executes synchronously and returns the result of the function (`1`), whereas `remote_function` immediately returns an `ObjectID` (a future) and then executes the task in the background on a separate worker process. The result of the future can be obtained by calling `ray.get` on the `ObjectID`.\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    >>> regular_function()\n",
    "    1\n",
    "    \n",
    "    >>> remote_function.remote()\n",
    "    ObjectID(1c80d6937802cd7786ad25e50caf2f023c95e350)\n",
    "    \n",
    "    >>> ray.get(remote_function.remote())\n",
    "    1\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "3. **Parallelism:** Invocations of `regular_function` happen **serially**:\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    # These are executed one at a time, back-to-back.\n",
    "    result = 0\n",
    "    for _ in range(4):\n",
    "        result += regular_function()\n",
    "    assert result == 4\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    In contrast, invocations of `remote_function` happen in **parallel**:\n",
    "    ```python\n",
    "    # Executing these functions happens at the same time in the background, and we get the results using ray.get.\n",
    "    results = []\n",
    "    for _ in range(4):\n",
    "        results.append(remote_function.remote())\n",
    "    assert sum(ray.get(results)) == 4\n",

Within each sequence, tasks are executed serially, but multiple sequences of tasks can be executed in parallel. You will use Ray to speed up the computation by parallelizing the sequences.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Concept for this Exercise - Task Dependencies\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the following basic remote function that returns the argument passed to it. If we pass in some normal Python objects, the results returned by `ray.get` should be the same objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "@ray.remote\n",
    "def f(x):\n",

    ">>> ray.get(x2_id)\n",
    "[1, 2, 3]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "However, **object IDs** can also be passed into remote functions. When the function is executed, Ray will automatically substitute the underlying Python object that the object ID refers to. In a sense, it's the same as calling `ray.get` on each argument that's passed in as an argument.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> y1_id = f.remote(x1_id)\n",
    ">>> ray.get(y1_id)\n",
    "1\n",
    "\n",
    ">>> y2_id = f.remote(x2_id)\n",
    ">>> ray.get(y2_id)\n",
    "[1, 2, 3]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "When implementing a remote function, the function should expect a regular Python object regardless of whether the caller passes in a regular Python object or an object ID.\n",
    "\n",
    "**These task dependencies affect scheduling.** In the example above, the task that creates `y1_id` depends on the task that creates `x1_id`. This means that:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The second task will not be executed until the first task has finished executing.\n",
    "- If the two tasks are scheduled on different machines, the output of the first task (the value corresponding to `x1_id`) will be copied over the network to the machine where the second task is scheduled."
